This module for Foundry VTT adds the ability to show a 3D dice simulation when a roll is made.

[[_TOC_]]

## Installation

To install, follow these instructions:

1.  Inside Foundry, select the Game Modules tab in the Configuration and Setup menu.
2.  Click the Install Module button and enter the following URL: https://gitlab.com/riccisi/foundryvtt-dice-so-nice/raw/master/module/module.json
3.  Click Install and wait for installation to complete.

Alternatively, use the integrated module manager in Foundry.

## Usage Instructions

There are no particular instructions for use. Once the module is enabled, 3D animation will be displayed each time dice is rolled on foundry.

## Configuration

It is possible to configure some aspects of the dice in the foundry game settings:

![Preview](/dice-so-nice-settings.jpg?raw=true)

- **Enable 3D dices**: Enable the 3D dice display in this browser session.
- **Dice Presets (Faces)**: Allows to select the dices faces. Default is "Standard" where every face is a text label. Some game systems can force this value for all players to display their own dices.
- **Theme**: Allows to select a color theme for your dices. Themes changes every color settings and can pack multiple colors that will be selected at random each time you roll. A theme can also include a default texture that will be displayed if you selected "None / Auto (Theme)" in the "Texture" dropdown.
- **Label Color**: Allows to change the color of the dices label. 
- **Dice Color**: Allows to change the color of the dices.
- **Outline Color**: Allows to change the color of the dices label outline.
- **Edge Color**: Allows to change the color of the edges of the dices.
- **Texture**: Allows to select a texture for the dices. Selecting "None / Auto (Theme)" will show the theme texture if there is one.
- **Automatically Hide**: When enabled, the dice disappear automatically after the result is displayed.
- **Millisecs Before Hiding**: time in milliseconds after which the dice disappear automatically.
- **Hide FX**: Effect used during dice hiding (not many, for now)
- **Sound Effects**: When enabled, custom sounds with "realistic" collision effects are played when the dices roll.
- **Auto Scale**: When enabled, auto scale the dices dimension based on the display size.
- **Manual Scale**: Allows to manually change the scale of the dice.
- **Shadows Quality**: Allows to select the shadows quality. Can help with performances on some PCs.
- **Animation Speed**: Change the speed at which the dices roll.

## Roll API
Once enabled, 'Dice So Nice' changes the behaviour of the API `Roll.toMessage` method so that a 3D dice animation is 
automatically displayed and resolved
before the result is shown on the chat log.    
This solves the majority of the cases related to the roll visualization when vanilla foundry is used.   
Customized Systems and Modules, however, may implement differently the way the roll is resolved and therefore they may
not use the `toMessage` method or they may not even use the `Roll` class entirely, in favor of custom random strategies for calculating the result.   
In this case, 'Dice so Nice' exposes APIs to trigger the animation and have a notification when finished.
If the Roll class is still used, activating the animation could be done using the `game.dice3d.showForRoll` method:
```javascript
const r = new Roll('1d20');
r.roll();
game.dice3d.showForRoll(r).then(displayed => { /*do you stuff after the animation */  });
```
`game.dice3d.showForRoll` returns a promise that is resolved once the animation has ended. The returned parameter is a boolean that 
informs if the animation took place or not.

Since version 1.3 it is possible to view other player's rolls so, two optionals parameters have been added to the signature:   
```javascript
game.dice3d.showForRoll(r, whisper, blind)
```
where: 
* `whisper`: array containing the User objects of other users who can see the roll (typically the DM)
* `blind`: when true the roll is not displayed, unless the id of the user is contained in the whisper array. 

If the `Roll` class is not used, you can alternatively call the `game.dice3d.show` method passing a JSON configuration data like so:

```javascript
const data = {
    formula: 'd20 + 2d6',
    results: [20,6,6]   ,
    whisper: null,
    blind: false
};
game.dice3d.show(data).then(displayed => { /*do your stuff after the animation */  }); 
```
The configuration must contain two parameters:

* **formula**: a string containing the dice to show formatted as `[n of dices if > 0]d[n of faces] [+...n]`, where the 'n of faces' can take only these values: 4,6,8,10,12,20,100. 
* **results** an array containing the ordered list of the roll results. In the example above 20 is the result of the d20, 6 and 6 of the 2d6.  

## Customization API
'Dice So Nice' expose an API for systems and modules to add their own customizations.

#### What is customizable
- **Colors**: Single color or an array of colors to use at random for every supported elements: background, label, outline and edges.
- **Background texture**: A single texture file for every dices with a defined blending mode
- **Faces**: Each dices can have custom faces. A face can be a string or an image file. The font can be changed and any Unicode character is supported (even symbols like emojis ðŸ¤©)

#### What is not supported yet
- **Per dice color/texture**: For now, you can't link a single dice type to a specific color or texture.

### Listening to DiceSoNiceReady hook
Before using the customization API, you must make sure that "Dice So Nice" is ready.
```javascript
Hooks.once('diceSoNiceReady', (dice3d) => {
    //...
});
```
### Adding a custom system (dice presets list)
A system (or "Dice Presets" for players) allows you to store a list of custom dices
```javascript
/**
 * Register a new system
 * The id is to be used with addDicePreset method
 * The name can be a localized string
 * @param {Object} system {id, name}
 * @param {Boolean} forceActivate Will force the activation of this system for all players. 
 * Other systems won't be available if you do so
 */
dice3d.addSystem({id: "13A", name: "13th Age"}, true);
```
### Adding a custom DicePreset (dice faces)
A custom DicePreset will override a default dice type when its system is selected in the "Dice So Nice" settings.
```javascript
/**
 * Register a new dice preset
 * Type should be a known dice type (d4,d6,d8,d10,d12,d20,d100)
 * Labels contains either strings (unicode) or a path to a texture (png, gif, jpg, webp)
 * The texture file size should be 256*256
 * The system should be a system id already registered
 * (Optional) The font is the name of the font family. (ex: Arial, monospace, etc)
 * @param {Object} dice {type:"",labels:[],system:"",font:""}
 */
dice3d.addDicePreset({
    type: "d20",
    labels: [
      "1",
      "2",
      "3",
      "4",
      "5",
      "6",
      "7",
      "8",
      "9",
      "10",
      "11",
      "12",
      "13",
      "14",
      "15",
      "16",
      "17",
      "18",
      "19",
      "systems/archmage/images/nat20.png"
    ],
    system: "13A"
  });
```
### Adding a custom texture
A background texture is displayed on every face of a dice on top of the dice color.
You can use any blending mode supported by HTMLCanvas2D (Full list: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing/Example)  
```javascript
/**
 * Add a texture to the list of textures and preload it
 * @param {String} textureID 
 * @param {Object} textureData 
 * @returns {Promise}
 */
dice3d.addTexture("13Ared", {
    name: "13th Age Red",
    composite: "source-over",
    source: "systems/archmage/images/redTexture.png"
});
```
### Adding a custom colorset (theme)
```javascript

/**
 * Add a colorset (theme)
 * name: String ID
 * description: Localized string for settings
 * category: Used to group the colorsets in the settings
 * foreground: Colors of the labels
 * background: Colors of the dice
 * outline: Colors of the label outline. Can be 'none'.
 * (Optional) edge: Colors of the edges
 * texture: ID of the texture to use if "None / Auto (Theme)" is selected in the settings. 
 * If it is a custom texture, make sure to call this function after the Promise from "addTexture" is resolved.
 * @param {Object} colorset 
 */
dice3d.addColorset({
    name: '13a',
    description: "13th Age Red/Gold",
    category: "13th Age",
    foreground: '#9F8003',
    background: "#9F8",
    texture: '13Ared',
    edge: '#9F8003'
});

dice3d.addColorset({
    name: 'rainbow',
    description: 'Rainbow',
    category: 'Colors',
    foreground: ['#FF5959','#FFA74F','#FFFF56','#59FF59','#2374FF','#00FFFF','#FF59FF'],
    background: ['#900000','#CE3900','#BCBC00','#00B500','#00008E','#008282','#A500A5'],
    outline: 'black',
    texture: 'none'
});
```

- The maximum number of dice displayed simultaneously is equal to 20.
- Works with vanilla foundry and with modules that do not substantially modify the Roll API.

## Compatibility

Tested on 0.6.2 version.
